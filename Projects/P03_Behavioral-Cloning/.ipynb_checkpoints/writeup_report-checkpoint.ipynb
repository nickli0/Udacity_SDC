    "\n",
    "**2.Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model **\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 54).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 74-89). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Model parameter tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 69).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Appropriate training data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ...\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Solution Design Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to following the reference document on Nvidia model, which received lots of recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model with 2-3 layers CNNs; however, these models with less CNNs interactions had fewer luck on producing a functional results. Then I had adopted the Nvidia model with more CNNs to explore with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model with Dropout keras function to reduce fitting on extreme data inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle riding along the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I had put more effort on the input data, like image fliping and cropping.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Final Model Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 30-71) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)"

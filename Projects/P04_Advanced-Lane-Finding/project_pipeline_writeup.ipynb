    "\n",
    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",

    "The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./project_pipeline.ipynb\". In the first part, denoted as \"1. Distortion Correction\", I have removed distortion from the images provided in \"./camera_cal/calibration*.jpg\".\n",

    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image. Thus, objpoints is a replicated array of coordinates, and objpoints will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image. imgpoints will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output objpoints and imgpoints to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the cv2.calibrateCamera() function. I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the cv2.undistort() function and obtained this result:\n",

    "I had tried searches that would not rely what an exact peak for the lanes in the bottom part of an image. So I took all possible candidates for each 1/7th of an image, and iterated through all of them with returning better peaks first. This process took more time than initially expected due to certain features on the image. I also had tried to derive btter candidates for each of the 1/7th of an image. This approach did return better perfermance that the last one as the score of lanes stopped improving upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are more time, I would like to trial the binary image combination process to make a better binary image for next step. Through trails of different colorspaces and channels, it should return a more detailed binary image for video processing. Also, I would pick a more accurate source and destination point for margining windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, this pipeline are likely to fail when there are two many shadow spots on road or the turn of road is too steep (radius of curvature is too small). Also, too much discoloration on road may overthrow the accuracy of this pipeline."
